In this project we are implementing a brain tumor detection and classification application by using Convolutional neural network (CNN). The application processes MRI images and detects and classifies the brain tumors. In this project, to obtain good performance and prevent overfitting in our
deep learning model, we will be using data augmentation techniques with the aim of increasing the size of our dataset. According to the research, itâ€™s been proven that Data augmentation is very efficient and is used globally in the field of deep learning (Vasconcelos,2017). It is in fact so effective
that it can even be used in tasks with large amounts of data (Wu et al.,2015). Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a family of unsupervised neural networks mainly used for image generation (Goodfellow et al.,2014). We will utilize GAN to make our dataset larger.
